# Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Network.

# Implementation of paper Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Network.

Requisites
1. Caffe (Deep Learning Library)

2. openCV (Computer Vision Library)

2. modelNweight 
Containing model files(prototxt file), weight files(caffemodel file) and mean file(binaryproto file).
You can also download those files and see details from below mentioned.
1) age_deploy.prototxt  
2) age_net.caffemodel
3) gender_deploy.prototxt
4) gender_net.caffemodel
5) opencv_face_detector.pbtxt
6) opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb
Note:- In these out of 6 files 2 files are not able to uploaded due to large size names are age_net.caffemodel and gender_net.caffemodel.

3. README
Containing implementation papers of age and gender prediction.

# note 
the code which I have written will showed you some error because I don't have proper platform to run the code properly and execute it and resolve the errors occured during the execution.
some problems which I faced during execution: 
1) ipykernal error.
2) python interpreter error.
3) unable to download the needed modules to run the code.
also I discussed these problems with the sir but even sir can't help me to figure out the actual problem just because of long distance he is also unable to figured out the actual problem that ocured in my sysytem.
